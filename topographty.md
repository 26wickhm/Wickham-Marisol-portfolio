#### Terrain2STL (https://jthatch.com/Terrain2STL/)
1. Find location and define model area by creating a red box around the georgraphy wanted
2. Adjust water drop and base height (default of 1 to start)
3. Generate model to download stl as a zip file
#### Aspire
4. Open Aspire and create new file
- Job type: single side

- Thickness (z): 1.0 inch
- Z Zero Position: Material surface (top)
- XY Datum Position: Bottom left
- Model Resolution: Standard
- Click "OK"
5. Import 3D Model
- Go to the modeling tab
- Click "Import a Component or 3D Model" and select your STL file
#### Orient 3D Model 
6. Orient 3D Model (Imported 3D Model > Transform)
- Rotation abouty Z axis: 0 degrees
