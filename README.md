## Project Overview

I am working with **Pearl (Atrium Hospital Rehabilitation Center)** to design and make medical assistive devices that either do not exist, are not customized, or are very expensive. The list below was given by nurses and doctors at the facility based on necessity of items. This allows us to cross-reference this with the level of difficulty of each project and set large goals and smaller goals to fill time.

### Project List

## Donning Tube

### Project Overview

Donning Tubes are a tool to put on compression socks. This is important for amputee patients and other specific patients. The compression sock (shrinker) is loaded onto the tube and then slid onto the limb.

I made **five different designs in Fusion360**. Two of them have handles (for those who may struggle to pull up on the tube when putting on a sock) and three without handles. These vary in size. I hope to finish with a **parametric design** that changes the dimensions according to the length/width/etc. of the limb.

**Design Notes**
- 2× handle versions (assist with pull force and grip)
- 3× no-handle versions (compact, simpler to fabricate)
- Goal: parameter-driven model (circumference, taper, wall thickness, handle geometry)

---

## Documentation

Use this section to link or embed:
- Design files (e.g., Fusion 360, STEP, STL)
- Photos / GIFs of prototypes and tests
- Notes from user testing with clinicians and patients
- Iteration logs and change history

**Suggested structure**
- `/design/` – CAD and exports  
- `/fabrication/` – toolpaths, machine settings, materials  
- `/testing/` – feedback notes, checklists, videos  
- `/releases/` – printable STLs and build instructions

## MakeraCAM

This section will document your MakeraCAM workflows:
- Machine: model, bed size, workholding
- Materials: type, thickness, feeds & speeds
- Tooling: endmills, stepdowns/stepovers
- CAM strategy: roughing/finishing, ramps, tabs, lead-ins
- Post-processing: sanding, deburring, fit checks

**Template checklist**
- [ ] Stock setup and Z-zero method  
- [ ] Tool list with diameters and stick-out  
- [ ] Feeds/speeds table per material  
- [ ] Simulation screenshots  
- [ ] Notes on tool wear and surface finish
