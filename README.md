#Project Overview
I am working with Pearl (Atrium Hospital Rehabilitation Center) to design and make medical assistive devices that either do not exist, are not customized, or very expensive. The list below was given to us by nurses and doctors at the facility based on necessity of items. This allows us to cross reference this with the level of difficulty of each project and set large goals and smaller goals to fill time.
