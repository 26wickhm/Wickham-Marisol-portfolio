## Project Overview
I am working with Pearl (Atrium Hospital Rehabilitation Center) to design and make medical assistive devices that either do not exist, are not customized, or very expensive. The list below was given to us by nurses and doctors at the facility based on necessity of items. This allows us to cross reference this with the level of difficulty of each project and set large goals and smaller goals to fill time.

# Donning Tube
## Project Overview 
Donning Tubes are a tool to put on compression socks. This is important for amputee patients and other specific patients. The compression sock (shrinker) is loaded onto the tube and then slid onto the limb. I made 5 differents designs in Fusion360. Two of them have handles (for those who may struggle to pull up on the tube when putting on a sock) and 3 without handles. These vary in size. I hope to finish with a parametric design that changes the dimensions according to length/width/etc of the limb.
