### Field & Lab Journal

First visit to the Atrium Carolina's Rehabilitation Center in Charlotte was 09/26. We toured their assistive technology lab and were able to see a lot of the current devices they are using. Then we took a tour of their gym on the first floor and met one of their patients "Jordan," a 23 year old male who has issues walking and tremors due to a stroke, and we were able to see him practice walking across the gym with a walker. We then toured the gym on the spinal and brain trauma floor and met a 21 year old we call "Shaq" whose spinal cord was severed after he was shot in the back. We discussed with the nurses what kinds of devices they were already using and what needed to be improved. 

**10/06/25** Today we began designing the donning tubes. Marisol made the design for the donning tube, but everyone else had input on dimensions. Our plan is to have 2 variations each with three possible sizes to ensure that the donning tubes can reach a wider group of patients. There will be short or long donning tubes that come in small, medium, and large sizes. Karlin and Caroline found a file for the quadstick mouthpiece to begin printing it out. Scarlett finished filling out the spreadsheet for everyone's jobs on the projects. 

**10/07/25** Today Marisol completed her 5 versions of the donning tubes and uploaded screenshots to the Git. Scarlett began printing for the mounts and organized the supports in Bambu accordingly. Karlin gathered the 3 hole narrow, 3 hole wide, 4 hole narrow, 4 hole wide models of the quadstick mouthpiece onto to 1 file and printed them. Marisol will add her designs to the shared drive with the hospital and will print next class. Caroline was not in class today but will continue working with Scarlett when she returns. 

**10/08/25** Today Scarlett and Caroline printed out an alternate option for the video game mount using ratchet locking joints. Marisol printed out the medium handles donning tube and had to scale it down to 70% to be able to fit on the printer because the design is too big for the plate. Karlin printed out another set of the Quadstick mouthpieces and adjusted some of the supports before printing. 

**10/10/25** Today Karlin started researching methods on how to attach a water bottle holder to a wheelchair. She discovered that using a holster similar to a bike water bottle holder would work best. She then moved on to designing and researching the best water bottle and straw attachment. 

**10/21/25** Today we put together our schedules in a spreadsheet to compare when we can host meetings with the other students that want to be involved with Pearl. This involved marking what days we can come before or stay after and assign projects such as mass printing jobs or recreating designs for us. Once we have a full meeting outside of school, it will be much easier to catch up during community time during school and check in on their progress and/or assign new tasks. This will be helpful because the younger/less experienced kids can get involved and help without having too much responsibility. This is also a cool opportunity for the four of us because we can focus on design and programming (the more creative side of Pearl) and less on watching the 3D printers crank out ten of the same design. However, it is good for the other students to learn how to handle all of the tools in the lab so it is a win-win for both parties. 

**10/22/25** Today I worked on the easy grip pill crushers. This involved two designs (one screw and one press). I began printing both of these to see which one is more effective. I found that if the screw design is to work, I need to add to where the pill is being crushed between. I also found that I need to print a bar to allow the file to hinge. I also worked on Github for 25 minutes to get used to making my digital portfolio; I learned how to do tables and change the size and bold of my text. 

**10/23/25** I spent most of my time on Github today. I also got both of the prints off of the Bambu, and began to design the hinge that I was referring to yesterday. 

**10/27/25** Today we learned about a new software called MakeraCAM. I have never worked on this before, and at first it was very complicated. We pulled 4 files from the main drive so that we could focus on how to specify it instead of the actual design right now. I learned how to center the design (using coordinates (6, 6) and making a pocket, contour, and drilling. I also learned how to add specific tools. This was helpful because I was able to learn new software (which will come in handy now that we have a new CNC machine). The benefits of this machine is that it switches out the tools unlike the manual version. This means that we can walk away after getting the g-code started, which leads to more efficiency in the lab. 

**10/30/25** Today I spent the majority of the day creating a slideshow to present to the students interested in working on Pearl. This included a training regime, an explanation on the program as a whole, and deciphering what level each person is on. 

**10/31/25** Today I used our new CNC machine to mill a board. This was from a design that I made on Makera (the files were precreated but I had to specify the design depth, where to pocket, contour, and drill). This involved following a workflow created by a classmate. This made the slightly complicated setup much easier to follow and check. I spent the other half of class (after I started running the program) on Github and updating my documentation and digital portfolio. 

**10/3/25** Today I worked on my job for Pearl as Operations Lead, meaning that I created groups for training based on level of experience. This was much more difficult than it sounds because I had to cross reference experience in three different catagories (CAD, 3D printing, and soldering) and times available. I utlized ChatGPT to organize these groups and then I sent out emails to each group with a training schedule. This below is a brief overview of what levels I will be training next week.

**10/5/25** Today I learned how to create parametric designs in Fusion 360. I learned this for the main intention of adapting my donning tube. This is because while there can be generic sizes (small, medium, large), it is much more effectie to use variables to define dimensions such as length, width, diameter, filleting, etc. This is helpful for the kids I am going to train because I can send them the dimensions necessary and they can input said dimensions and print without needing to rework my whole design. I deleted the 5 versions of the files I had and created two instead. Both are parametric; one has handles and one does not. 

**10/7/25** Today the team and I worked on communication with the hospital. This included adding photos and designs to a shared OneDrive as well as writing a lengthy email involving next zoom meeting availabilies, future internship opportunities, and updates on our progress. We have a meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 8:00 AM. 

**10/11/25** Today we had our meeting with Heather Smith about our progress. This meeting was about 45 minutes and in the conversation we updated on our projects and heard feedback. The feedback I recieved about the donning tube is that parametric is a very smart way to keep the design, the tube can be one diameter instead of cone-like, and that there is a slight problem with the handle. While she did enjoy the concept, sometimes they put the sock over the opposite end of the tube to secure it while they roll it on. After discussion, I realized that we can keep the handles if I can create a ledge above them for the sock to hold on to. Karlin updated on her quad sticks and recieved positive remarks about the variety of designs including size and amount of holes to blow into. Scarlett and Caroline showed their progress on their mounts and learned more about the design aspects they want and don't want. Overall, today was very productive and we have another zoom meeting scheduled for November 18th.
