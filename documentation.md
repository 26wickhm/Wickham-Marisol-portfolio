### Field & Lab Journal

First visit to the Atrium Carolina's Rehabilitation Center in Charlotte was 09/26. We toured their assistive technology lab and were able to see a lot of the current devices they are using. Then we took a tour of their gym on the first floor and met one of their patients "Jordan," a 23 year old male who has issues walking and tremors due to a stroke, and we were able to see him practice walking across the gym with a walker. We then toured the gym on the spinal and brain trauma floor and met a 21 year old we call "Shaq" whose spinal cord was severed after he was shot in the back. We discussed with the nurses what kinds of devices they were already using and what needed to be improved. 

**10/06/25** Today we began designing the donning tubes. Marisol made the design for the donning tube, but everyone else had input on dimensions. Our plan is to have 2 variations each with three possible sizes to ensure that the donning tubes can reach a wider group of patients. There will be short or long donning tubes that come in small, medium, and large sizes. Karlin and Caroline found a file for the quadstick mouthpiece to begin printing it out. Scarlett finished filling out the spreadsheet for everyone's jobs on the projects. 

**10/07/25** Today Marisol completed her 5 versions of the donning tubes and uploaded screenshots to the Git. Scarlett began printing for the mounts and organized the supports in Bambu accordingly. Karlin gathered the 3 hole narrow, 3 hole wide, 4 hole narrow, 4 hole wide models of the quadstick mouthpiece onto to 1 file and printed them. Marisol will add her designs to the shared drive with the hospital and will print next class. Caroline was not in class today but will continue working with Scarlett when she returns. 

**10/08/25** Today Scarlett and Caroline printed out an alternate option for the video game mount using ratchet locking joints. Marisol printed out the medium handles donning tube and had to scale it down to 70% to be able to fit on the printer because the design is too big for the plate. Karlin printed out another set of the Quadstick mouthpieces and adjusted some of the supports before printing. 

**10/10/25** Today Karlin started researching methods on how to attach a water bottle holder to a wheelchair. She discovered that using a holster similar to a bike water bottle holder would work best. She then moved on to designing and researching the best water bottle and straw attachment. 

**10/21/25** Today we put together our schedules in a spreadsheet to compare when we can host meetings with the other students that want to be involved with Pearl. This involved marking what days we can come before or stay after and assign projects such as mass printing jobs or recreating designs for us. Once we have a full meeting outside of school, it will be much easier to catch up during community time during school and check in on their progress and/or assign new tasks. This will be helpful because the younger/less experienced kids can get involved and help without having too much responsibility. This is also a cool opportunity for the four of us because we can focus on design and programming (the more creative side of Pearl) and less on watching the 3D printers crank out ten of the same design. However, it is good for the other students to learn how to handle all of the tools in the lab so it is a win-win for both parties. 

**10/22/25** Today I worked on the easy grip pill crushers. This involved two designs (one screw and one press). I began printing both of these to see which one is more effective. I found that if the screw design is to work, I need to add to where the pill is being crushed between. I also found that I need to print a bar to allow the file to hinge. I also worked on Github for 25 minutes to get used to making my digital portfolio; I learned how to do tables and change the size and bold of my text. 

**10/23/25** I spent most of my time on Github today. I also got both of the prints off of the Bambu, and began to design the hinge that I was referring to yesterday. 

**10/27/25** Today we learned about a new software called MakeraCAM. I have never worked on this before, and at first it was very complicated. We pulled 4 files from the main drive so that we could focus on how to specify it instead of the actual design right now. I learned how to center the design (using coordinates (6, 6) and making a pocket, contour, and drilling. I also learned how to add specific tools. This was helpful because I was able to learn new software (which will come in handy now that we have a new CNC machine). The benefits of this machine is that it switches out the tools unlike the manual version. This means that we can walk away after getting the g-code started, which leads to more efficiency in the lab. 

**10/30/25** Today I spent the majority of the day creating a slideshow to present to the students interested in working on Pearl. This included a training regime, an explanation on the program as a whole, and deciphering what level each person is on. 

**10/31/25** Today I used our new CNC machine to mill a board. This was from a design that I made on Makera (the files were precreated but I had to specify the design depth, where to pocket, contour, and drill). This involved following a workflow created by a classmate. This made the slightly complicated setup much easier to follow and check. I spent the other half of class (after I started running the program) on Github and updating my documentation and digital portfolio. 

**11/3/25** Today I worked on my job for Pearl as Operations Lead, meaning that I created groups for training based on level of experience. This was much more difficult than it sounds because I had to cross reference experience in three different catagories (CAD, 3D printing, and soldering) and times available. I utlized ChatGPT to organize these groups and then I sent out emails to each group with a training schedule. This below is a brief overview of what levels I will be training next week.

**11/5/25** Today I learned how to create parametric designs in Fusion 360. I learned this for the main intention of adapting my donning tube. This is because while there can be generic sizes (small, medium, large), it is much more effectie to use variables to define dimensions such as length, width, diameter, filleting, etc. This is helpful for the kids I am going to train because I can send them the dimensions necessary and they can input said dimensions and print without needing to rework my whole design. I deleted the 5 versions of the files I had and created two instead. Both are parametric; one has handles and one does not. 

**11/7/25** Today the team and I worked on communication with the hospital. This included adding photos and designs to a shared OneDrive as well as writing a lengthy email involving next zoom meeting availabilies, future internship opportunities, and updates on our progress. We have a meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 8:00 AM. 

**11/11/25** Today we had our meeting with Heather Smith about our progress. This meeting was about 45 minutes and in the conversation we updated on our projects and heard feedback. The feedback I recieved about the donning tube is that parametric is a very smart way to keep the design, the tube can be one diameter instead of cone-like, and that there is a slight problem with the handle. While she did enjoy the concept, sometimes they put the sock over the opposite end of the tube to secure it while they roll it on. After discussion, I realized that we can keep the handles if I can create a ledge above them for the sock to hold on to. Karlin updated on her quad sticks and recieved positive remarks about the variety of designs including size and amount of holes to blow into. Scarlett and Caroline showed their progress on their mounts and learned more about the design aspects they want and don't want. Overall, today was very productive and we have another zoom meeting scheduled for November 18th. 

**11/12/25-11/13/25** On these two days I worked to make my GIT design better with the changes that Heather Smith adviced. To do this, I added a hollowed out triangle revolving around the cylinder right above the handle to create a place for the compression sock to hook around. However, there are a few challenges with this. For one, I had to abandon the parametric design for now because I was back in the designing stage and could not do that while creating variables. I have found that it is easier to finalize my idea and then go back and see how I want the dimensions to relate to eachother in the parametrics. The second issue is that I cannot tell if the hook will have enough space under it for the sock and I cannot do this without printing a whole new donning tube. They take around 7 hours to print and take alot of PLA, so I try to refrain from doing so until necessary. 

_Thanksgiving break from 11/22/25 to 11/30/25_

**12/1/25-12/5/25** This whole week is combined documentation because we had a review week on electrical engineering. This included alot of Tinkercad, where we simulated different circuits including some with LEDs, potentiometers, servos, and arduinos (obviously with the necessary parts like buttons, resistors, wires, etc). This week was pretty basic because the whole class took honors electrical engineering last year so we know arduino code and reviewed when to use digital (boolean values (true or false, on or off)) or analog (a range of values, such as the dimming of an LED). It wwas helpful to do this because our projects have a required electronics component. Mine may not (exception because I am working with Pearl) but if it does arise I will need to remember these basics.

**12/8/25** Today I cut my CNC topography into the wood block. This took a long time to set up because we are all still figuring out the machine. This was confusing because it only exported as a CNC much we thought that it needed to be an NC because it initially did not work. However, I learned how to work it very quickly and realized that it is much easier to learn by doing then through a workflow. I offset my cut at (6,6) to cut in the rectangle instead of on one side of it. It took about 2.5 hours to cut and it turned out very good. I need to cut the excess wood off of the sides to isolate the mountain. 

**12/9/25** We did not have class today, but I came in and cut off the excess wood from my topography wood. I also sanded it down so that there was no lip between where the mountain and the flat section began. 

**12/10/25** Today we went in person to visit Atrium Rehabilitation Center and meet with Heather Smith regarding our designs. Firs off, I brought my donning tube (with generic sizing of a diameter of 12 inches and a height of 9 inches). Heather was initially concerned about the handles getting in the way of the sock, but after consideration, she decided that it did not and was actually a great design idea. The donning tube was left with her and will be implemented on the next amputee patient who needs it. Karlin Smith got feedback on her quadstick, learning that the screws did not fit the design, and she will continue by trying to make them built in. Scarlett and Caroline set up and showed their mount system, and recieved comments about the strength of the locks and the differing attachments that they will have in order to make it more versatile. 

**12/10/25** Today I went back and made the final donning tube design parametric. Before, I had many variables, but I decided that I only wanted to have 2. I made every single dimension dependent on the diameter (except for the hight). I wanted the height to be seperate because there may be a need for a longer or shorter body regardless of the width. This included every offset, fillet, and extrusion being an equation revolving the variable "diameter". 

**12/11/25** Today I documented all of the work that I have been doing all week and continued to fulfill my duties as Operation Lead. To do this, I responded to all emails pertaining to CAD design, letting advanced students know which projects are available and what conditions they need to be under. I also completed my Git page for the donning tube- the only thing I may have to do is copy and paste certain documentation over to it so that someone does not need to read through all of my documentation if they only want the parts about the donning tube.
