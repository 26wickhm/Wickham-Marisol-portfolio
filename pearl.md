## Overview

I am working with **Pearl (Atrium Hospital Rehabilitation Center)** with three other students to design and make medical assistive devices that either do not exist, are not customized, or are very expensive. The list below was given by nurses and doctors at the facility based on necessity of items. This allows us to cross-reference this with the level of difficulty of each project and set large goals and smaller goals to fill time.

## Donning Tube

### Project Overview

Donning Tubes are a tool to put on compression socks.  This is important for amputee patients because the end of the limb needs to be molded after surgery. The compression sock (shrinker) is loaded onto the tube and then slid onto the limb. This reduced friction on the limb as well as ensuring that thre sock is taught and does not have bunches of fabric.
