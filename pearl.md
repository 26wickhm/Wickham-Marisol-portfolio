## Overview

I am working with **Pearl (Atrium Hospital Rehabilitation Center)** to design and make medical assistive devices that either do not exist, are not customized, or are very expensive.  
The list below was given by nurses and doctors at the facility based on necessity of items.  
This allows us to cross-reference this with the level of difficulty of each project and set large goals and smaller goals to fill time.

## Leadership Positions

Our team operates on a rotating leadership system every two months to ensure that everyone gains experience in both design and management roles.  
Each position oversees a specific aspect of Pearl’s development and collaboration with the Atrium Hospital Rehabilitation Center.

| **Name** | **Position** | **Role Overview** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Marisol** | Operations Lead | Manages lab operations, training, and production schedules. Coordinates between design and production teams. |
| **Caroline** | Project Coordinator | Liaises with hospital staff and ensures deliverables meet medical timelines and feedback. |
| **Karlin** | Technical & Design Lead | Oversees device design, CAD accuracy, and manufacturability for production runs. |
| **Scarlett** | Quality & Safety Lead | Ensures product standards, safety compliance, and final inspection before delivery. |

#### Operations Lead – Marisol (Current Role)
As **Operations Lead**, I manage training for all student participants.  
This includes organizing schedules, creating structured training groups by experience level (CAD, 3D printing, and soldering), and leading onboarding sessions for new members.

## Donning Tube

### Project Overview

Donning Tubes are a tool to put on compression socks.  
This is important for amputee patients and others who need assistance.  
The compression sock (shrinker) is loaded onto the tube and then slid onto the limb.

### Parametric Designs (With & Without Handles)

I created **two parametric Donning Tube designs** — one **with handles** and one **without**.  
This parametric setup improves **efficiency**, **customizability**, and **training simplicity** for students I teach in the lab.  
By changing only key parameters (diameter, height, handle size), we can generate new sizes instantly without editing geometry.

#### Version A — With Handles

| ![Donning tube with handles render](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab70dc7d-da51-4d92-9ed5-4c896518ab5b) | ![Donning tube with handles parameters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d27e45d-5e66-4755-817f-c04c4b70c243) |
|:--:|:--:|
| **Render** — Cylindrical tube with two ergonomic handles for better grip and leverage. | **Parameters** — Adjustable diameter, height, handle length/width/height, and fillets for quick customization. |

---

#### Version B — Without Handles

| ![Donning tube without handles render](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed43fa29-e428-4282-ac80-c2f1bb706844) | ![Donning tube without handles parameters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbe9640d-483a-45b7-85ec-3c7d9253bd38) |
|:--:|:--:|
| **Render** — Compact version without handles; ideal when space or print time matters. | **Parameters** — Simplified parametric setup with adjustable diameter and height for quick resizing. |


**Next Steps:** 
- test on patients at the hospital
- train students in parametrics and using the Bambu printers
- track how much of a need there are for donning tubes and calculate price and projected production
