# MakeraCAM

## Overview

We started using **MakeraCAM** with our new CNC machine that has an **auto tool-changer**. This makes milling way faster and easier since it switches tools automatically — so you can start a job and work on something else while it runs.

### Learning the Software

We learned how to:
- Import files and center them using coordinates (like `(6,6)` for alignment)
- Create **pockets**, **contours**, and **drilling paths**
- Assign tools and set up tool changes
- Export and run the g-code on the CNC

Below is what the toolpath looks like in MakeraCAM before milling:

### Milling the Board

After setting up the design, we placed the copper board on the CNC bed and ran the job. It milled all the traces and drilled the holes automatically.

### Notes & Takeaways

- The auto tool-changer saves a lot of time  
- The traces came out clean and sharp  
- We learned how to adjust feed rates, depth, and pocketing for different materials
