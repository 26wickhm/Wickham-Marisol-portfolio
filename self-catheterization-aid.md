## Overview 

A self catheterization aid is intended for those who need to self-catheterize at home. A person who requires this does it around 4-6 times a day. Many people, primarily women, struggle with insertion because of a lack of visuals and lighting. This is also difficult because many patients who need to self catheterize also do not have full mobility over their legs, struggling to hold them open. Therefore, my design aims to provide a leg brace for the patient (holding the legs apart), contain an adjustable mirror that they can move to increase visibility, and LED's lining the mirror for better lighting. 

## Research
Largest causes of a need for self-catheterization:

**Neurogenic bladder**
- effects both men and women
- Caused by:
  - Spinal cord injury 
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Spina bifida
  - Stroke 
  - Parkinson's disease
  - Diabetic autonomic neuropathy 
  - Cauda equina syndrome
  - Transverse myelitis 
- Bladder emptying is impaired because nerve signals don't work properly 
- Normally long term

**Obstructory urinary retention** 
- In men
  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia 
  - Prostate cancer 
  - Post prostate surgery complications 
  - Urethral strictures 
- In women
  - Pelvic organ prolapse
  - Urethral strictures (rare)
  - Post pelvic surgery obstruction 

**Post-surgical urinary retention**
- The bladder doesn’t empty properly after surgery due to anesthesia or nerve irritation
  - Pelvic surgery (gynecologic, colorectal)
  - Orthopedic surgery (hip, spine)
  - Urologic procedures

**Dysfunctional voiding / detrusor underactivity**
- Bladder muscle is weak or uncoordinated.
  - Aging population
  - Idiopathic chronic retention
  - Long-standing bladder overdistension
  - Some psychiatric medication effects
