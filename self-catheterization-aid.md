### Overview 

A self catheterization aid is intended for those who need to self-catheterize at home. A person who requires this does it around 4-6 times a day. To do this, primarily women, struggle with insertion because of a lack of visuals and lighting. This is also difficult because many patients who need to self catheterize also do not have full mobility over their legs, struggling to hold them open. Therefore, my design aims to provide a leg brace for the patient (holding the legs apart), contain an adjustable mirror that they can move to increase visibility, and LED's lining the mirror for better lighting.
